# DNA Problem set

This problem set involved creating a program that would scan a text file of genetic code and identify the number of specific repeated sequences. These repeated sequences of proteins are known as STRs (short tandem repeats). They can be used to identify individuals as its (almost) impossible for two people to have the same amount. The next part of the problem set involved writing code to cross-reference the identified STRs with a large database of individuals' STR types and amounts to check for a match.
