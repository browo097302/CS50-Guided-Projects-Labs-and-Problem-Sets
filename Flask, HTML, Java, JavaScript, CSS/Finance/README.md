# Finance Problem Set
This was an extensive problem class that involved creating a website that users could buy and sell shares on. It used real stock market data from an API and calculated and displayed the users portfolio holdings. It also functioned to calculate if certain shares could actually be traded given their current liquidity and holdings with warnings and error messages if not. Transactions are all logged on different page with all the key details that update with each purchase/sale. One addition touch was an option for users to inject more of their own cash. All of which being organised onto a user friendly web interface.
