# Tideman Problem Class

In this class we were required to create a program that recieves voter preferences for a chosen number of candidates and uses the Tideman method of caclulating and returning the winner. 

The Tideman voting method (also known as “ranked pairs”) is a ranked-choice voting method that’s guaranteed to produce the Condorcet winner of the election if one exists. Condorcet winner is a candidate who would win a head-to-head comparison against each of the other candidates.
